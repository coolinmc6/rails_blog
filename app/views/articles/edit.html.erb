<!-- edit.html.erb -->
<!-- 
-I was able to get rid of pretty much all the code in here by transferring everything into a partial called 'form'.
-'form' is located in the articles folder under views because it is for articles
-All of these comments show up in the body of the html document

<h1>Edit article</h1>
 
<%= render 'form' %>
 
<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>
